How to talk to anyone TakeAways

    Don’t be an unconscious ummer. Vocalize complete sentences to show your understanding. Dust your dialogue with phrases like ‘I see what you mean.’ Sprinkle it with sentimental sparklers like ‘That’s a lovely thing to say.’ Your empathy impresses your listeners and encourages them to continue.
    Of course, you pay a price. In order to use the right empathizers, you do need to listen.
