How to talk to anyone TakeAways

T-1
    Don’t be an unconscious ummer. Vocalize complete sentences to show your understanding.
    Dust your dialogue with phrases like ‘I see what you mean.’
    Sprinkle it with sentimental sparklers like ‘That’s a lovely thing to say.’
    Your empathy impresses your listeners and encourages them to continue.
    Of course, you pay a price. In order to use the right empathizers, you do need to listen.

T-2
    Echoing is a simple linguistic technique that packs a powerful wallop.
    Listen to the speaker’s arbitrary choice of nouns, verbs, prepositions,
    adjectives – and echo them back.
    Hearing their words come out of your mouth creates subliminal rapport.
    It makes them feel you share their values, their attitudes, 

T-3
    Watch people. Look at the way they move. Small movements? Big movements?
    Fast? Slow? Jerky? Fluid? Old? Young? Classy? Trashy?
    Pretend the person you are talking to is your dance instructor.
    Is he a jazzy mover? Is she a balletic mover? Watch his or her body,
    then imitate the style of movement. That makes your Conversation Partner
    subliminally real comfy with you.
