Do Epic Shit TakeAways

T-1    
    The most memorable moments of your life would have a sense of freedom attached to them.
    That moment of passing your exams, because now you would be financially independent!
    Those moments of awe in meditation, when you figured it was possible to break your inner patterns!
    The moment of simply getting out of the city on your car or bike.
    We remember the moments not for what they are.
    We remember the moments for what they make us feel.
    We remember the moments not for where they take place.
    We remember the moments for where they take us within.

T-2
    The best mental model for taking tough decisions in life?
    1. Ask yourself, ‘What’s the worst thing that can happen?’
    2. Close your eyes and vividly imagine it happening.
    3. Then ask, ‘Will I be okay – mentally, socially, financially, physically, emotionally?’
    If yes, go for it.

T-3
    Not making a decision because you are scared of making the wrong decision?
    If you don’t move, you would’ve already made the wrong decision.
    When you make a decision, you will either succeed. Or you won’t.
    When you succeed, you will know how life works.
    When you won’t, you will learn a life-altering lesson.
    Neither of this will happen if you stay where you are.
    Movement brings momentum.
    Stagnation amplifies sadness.
