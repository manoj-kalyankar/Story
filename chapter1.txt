Do Epic Shit TakeAways

    The most memorable moments of your life would have a sense of freedom attached to them.
    That moment of passing your exams, because now you would be financially independent!
    Those moments of awe in meditation, when you figured it was possible to break your inner patterns!
    The moment of simply getting out of the city on your car or bike.
    We remember the moments not for what they are.
    We remember the moments for what they make us feel.
    We remember the moments not for where they take place.
    We remember the moments for where they take us within.
